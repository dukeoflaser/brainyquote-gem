# BrainyQuote
A simple Command Line Interface that allows the user to receive a randomly
selected quote based on topic of the user's choice.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'brainyquote'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install brainyquote

## Usage

After installation, simply type `brainyquote` to access the BrainyQuote interface.
Hitting 'enter' will display a list of topics.
Choose a topic via the associated number to receive a quote.
The user can type `y` to get another quote from the same topic as many times
as he or she wishes.
Type `n` to view the list of topics again.
Leave the interface at any time by typing `exit`.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
